# Comparative study of Style Transfer Models

## About the Project
### 1. Introduction
 In this paper, we explore different implementations of style transfer models, examining which models work best, and experimenting with ways to achieve better results. In
particular, we will examine two models, and two different input types. The first model we focus on is a classic VGG19 based GAN model. The second model is the dual style
GAN model which is the current state of the art model for style transfer. Finally, we experiment with the input to the models to see if preprocessing the training data results in more accurate style transfers. In particular, we examine if taking the edges or contours of a training image before passing it to the model increases style fidelity.
